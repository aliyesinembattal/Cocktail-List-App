          A cocktail is a mixed drink typically made with a distilled liquor (such as arrack, brandy, cacha√ßa, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, or whiskey) as its base ingredient that is then mixed with other ingredients or garnishments. Sweetened liqueurs, wine, or beer may also serve as the base or be added. If beer is one of the ingredients, the drink is called a beer cocktail.
